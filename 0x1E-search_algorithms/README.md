C - Search Algorithms
Search algorithms are fundamental techniques used in computer science and data structures to find a specific element or determine the existence of an element within a collection of data. These algorithms are employed in various applications, including searching for a particular value in a sorted array, finding the shortest path in a graph, or locating a specific record in a database.

Here are some commonly used search algorithms:

Linear Search: In linear search, each element in the collection is examined sequentially until a match is found or the entire collection has been traversed. It is simple to implement, but its time complexity is O(n), where n is the size of the collection. Linear search is suitable for small or unsorted data sets.

Binary Search: Binary search is applicable only to sorted collections (such as arrays or lists). It operates by repeatedly dividing the search space in half, eliminating the half in which the target cannot reside. Binary search has a time complexity of O(log n), which makes it efficient for large sorted collections.

Hashing: Hashing is a technique that uses a hash function to map data to an index or a key. By storing elements in specific locations based on their hash values, searching can be performed in constant time on average. Hashing is commonly used in hash tables or dictionaries.

Depth-First Search (DFS): DFS is an algorithm used to traverse or search through a graph or tree data structure. It explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. DFS can be implemented recursively or using a stack. It is often used in problems such as finding connected components or traversing a maze.

Breadth-First Search (BFS): BFS explores all the vertices or nodes of a graph in breadth-first order, starting from a given source vertex. It visits all the neighbors of a vertex before moving to the next level. BFS can be implemented using a queue. It is commonly used to find the shortest path between two nodes or to perform level order traversal.

A* Search Algorithm: A* is an informed search algorithm that uses heuristic functions to guide the search. It combines elements of both DFS and BFS by considering both the cost of reaching a node and the estimated cost of reaching the goal from that node. A* is commonly used in pathfinding problems, such as finding the shortest path in a graph.

These are just a few examples of search algorithms used in computer science. Each algorithm has its own characteristics and is suited to different scenarios depending on the problem and data structure involved.
